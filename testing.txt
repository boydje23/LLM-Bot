From the spine-chilling suspense of a horror film to the adrenaline-pumping action of a thriller, the world offers a diverse range of genres, each with its own set of storytelling techniques and emotional impact. But what lies beyond these genres' surface? Analyzing work while focusing on genre allows readers to fully understand the deeper meaning and the purpose behind the writing. Although two seemingly different genres such as sonnets and analytical essays seem different they are actually quite similar. Examining the differences between school and self-sponsored writing we will critique how genres could have a lot of overlap. By exploring these themes we hope to further our understanding of writing and foster a love for the flexibility of genres. Focusing on the audience-to-author interaction and organization/ format of writing we learn a lot about how the genre allows for the author to make sense of their emotions and arguments. Genres serve as essential organizational tools in human communication and society, preventing confusion and promoting effective expression. These conventions, collectively shaped by society rather than a single authority, foster unity and agreement in a world filled with divisive issues. Moreover, genres not only aid authors in conveying their intentions but also facilitate a meaningful connection between writers and their readers, reinforcing the importance of adhering to established genre patterns for effective communication.   

These distinct characteristics of sonnets and analytical essays emphasize the purposeful choices of authors make to convey their messages within these genres. A sonnet is a poem of fourteen lines using any of a number of formal rhyme schemes, in English typically having ten syllables per line. Sonnets are typically more emotional and personal. With that being said, the interaction between the author and the audience is passion-driven. The author believes in something greatly and wants the audience to feel and understand their point. It is almost used to persuade the reader of their claim. On the other hand, an analytical essay intricately examines a single topic to explain specific arguments or prove the author's theories. They commonly deal with creative works like art, literature, film, or music, dissecting the creator's artistic themes and revealing hidden meanings. With this being said you wouldn't use an analytical essay for a summary or an advertisement for a Chipotle commercial. Genres are specific to what you are writing about. Even this paper right here, explaining my opinion about certain types of genres. Furthermore, Sonnets have a very similar trait. Sonnets are also quite unique and specific. Sonnets conventionally can't be used in everyday writing since it would be difficult to communicate directly. If someone sends a text message only as a sonnet many people would leave them on read or delivered. For my school-sponsored and self-sponsored writing, both are specific to their genre as far as it's not conventional to use in multiple situations. Let’s take my sonnet Ghost, 

“You're healing and hurting at the same time 
You want to find the calm to ease your mind
But lately that has been so hard to find
And for some reason that feels like a crime”

This sonnet is about how I have had to code-switch in many instances of my life so much that I don’t recognize which version of myself is the real me. This is specific to this genre because of how it is written. The rhyme scheme between time and mind, fine and crime, along with the specific amount of syllables, all show how this is unique to this specific genre, sonnets. Although, since the language could be described as indirect or cryptic, many people can interpret the meaning differently. I am talking about identity while someone else could see how this sonnet refers to mental health. It depends on the audience's headspace and understanding of the author. 

Similarly, analytical essays, despite their contrasting writing styles, are also specific to their genre. In These Stains Last Forever, I start the essay off with “The Human Stain, a novel by Philip Roth, depicts the image of the human stain by posing the question of the original stain. The stain represents Roth's perception of human flaws, which he expresses not only through the main characters Les, Faunia, and Coleman, but also by involving the reader in defining societal issues.” This statement would not fit in a play, or a children's book which makes it quite definite in its genre. This convention of how these two genres are unique to themselves is very important to take into account. It tells the audience that out of all the different genres,  the author purposely chose this way of expressing their message.

The analytical essay has a very similar goal to the sonnet since both try to convince the audience of something that they feel passionate about. After the author of an analytical paper has read or watched whatever they are analyzing they will have an emotion or an opinion about what they just experienced. Which then means their opinions and emotions are embedded in their analysis. This then, in turn, depending on if they are aware of what the topic that is being analyzed is, makes the audience question if they agree with the point or not. There will inevitably be an internal debate. 

For instance in my essay called Pure Darkness which was based on the Novel “Heart of Darkness,” I stated that “To entertain this novel means to give this message power and relevancy. Although it is considered a classic novel, it should be questioned why certain novels are considered classics. It's also important to ask whether teaching a classic work is appropriate.” That statement is subjective since I have had certain life experiences that I couldn't expect everyone to also have. Meaning that somebody else even after reading my critique could completely disagree, thus making my claim arguable as I was trying to prove how the novel should no longer be taught and to question why we call certain books classics.

Transitioning to sonnets, in my piece lucid air, I stated, 

“Oh young boy, beware of the smoke's embrace,
And find the peace that comes from love and grace.”

Here I was trying to warn a young boy of smoke. There was intention and passion behind this statement because I know how damaged people can become because of smoke. Once again someone who is addicted to the smoke could disagree and continue to smoke. The internal debate is once again seen here. But sometimes writing is directed at certain audiences. Take my Sonnet example Breakup Text, 
“I leave you there so broke and all alone, 
Our kiss, your heart, was just my silly game 
Our love was something that we should atone 
We split, our paths, are simply not the same”

While this verse could be generalized I was specifically writing to my Ex-girlfriend. The language used was specifically from my experience. The idea of passion and purpose is still evident. Even in my Analytical essay Pure Darkness, I was writing directly to the school administration and my teacher. It was an AP Lit essay assignment at first but then repurposed to propose it to the principal and writing chair. In this case, instead of disagreeing with my claims they agreed and decided to remove the book from the school's AP Lit curriculum. So although anyone could read my essay, there was a direct target audience to which I was writing. The author-to-audience purpose is very similar between sonnets and essays.

The structure and organization of a Sonnet is very purposeful. based on the author's places where certain words are and what punctuation is used are all a part of self-expression. A poem that is more direct and has a tone of being angry and spoken fast might have no punctuation with capitalization on impactful words. Words might be underlined or bold. There might be words sprawled across the page in disarray. Or a poem that is more dreamy like lucid air where there are a lot of punctuation and pauses with more of a light feel, not to mention the title all being in all lowercase adding to the main purpose of the sonnet. 

“He takes a drag, and then he takes a breath,
His eyes half-closed, his movement still, and froze
His mind, it drifts, to worlds that's full of depth 
And he forgets the worries that he knows.”

The commas after each thought, “his mind, it drifts,” and “his movement still, and froze” are examples of how there is a dreamy feel to the sonnet. I did this on purpose so the thoughts are drawn out for longer instead of rushed through. 

The essays are quite similar. The essay is structured in body paragraphs with an introduction to what is going to be discussed along with a conclusion. This format keeps the audience focused on what the main claim is while also allowing it to have a uniform and more professional look. Conventionally school analytical essays are 5 paragraphs long. School essays also have body paragraphs that are indented to show how they are subtopics or supporting information for the main claim. 

Sonnets on the contrary tend to get even more intricate based on how deep the audience wants to read into it. For example, all my sonnets are personal and heartfelt and speak from a position of passion. But why did I choose sonnets to express those stories and emotions? The answer lies in the format of the sonnet. Sonnets as mentioned earlier have 14 lines and each line has 10 syllables. If read with a rhythm it could resemble a sound of a heartbeat. bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum. This heartbeat directly relates to the messages behind the sonnets since they are personal pieces. This connection could be vague to a lot of people but the choice of this writing style was purposeful. The reason why we have genres and genre conventions is because they help support the main claim of any writing. Once when a summary is written as an essay it loses its value and importance. Essays are longer and more detailed while summaries are used to quickly get the gist of what is written. The reason for both my school-sponsored writing and self-sponsored especially in those categories of analytical essays and sonnets respectively, is very intentional.   

Genres are what keep us organized and how humans are able to communicate effectively.  Without genres, society would be confused and very politically incorrect. Imagine writing a eulogy in the voice of a comedian… terrible I know! But since we have conventions we are able to communicate efficiently. It is also important to note that these conventions and genres were not set by one authority figure but by society as a whole. There is beauty and appreciation that we as a community can come together to set normative values in things like writing when there are so many other aspects in life people can never and probably will never agree on due to how polarizing certain topics can be. Not to mention that genres are helpful not only for the authors to express themselves but also for the audience to understand the real meaning behind the authors writing. Using acknowledged genre patterns to accomplish their goals allows them to develop a functional relationship with readers. When writers deviate from the genres commonly accepted by readers—and there are no laws, only options—they risk alienating an audience. For example, if a film critic breaks the genre practice of keeping major narrative aspects, particularly the finale, hidden, readers may find the film spoiled for them. If a reviewer does this on a number of movie review websites, the editors mark their review with a spoiler warning—namely, "spoilers!" People are kept together and connected by genres. So, the longer we can respect our love for genres, the longer we can maintain the literary world peaceful.







from some stronger framing topic sentences, and maybe a little more intra-paragraph transitions since you move between the two genres a lot within paragraphs. Maybe if you started each paragraph with a statement about GENRE instead of these specific genres? And then try to focus on one before moving to the other in each paragraph? Or maybe even shorter paragraphs? 
This is what I will be changing in my essay. 
Okay. I added multiple transitions and broke down the extremely long paragraphs into easily manageable chunks. 
Starting each paragraph with a general idea about the genre I could take away from the overall claim, or it might get repetitive
I really tried to change up the order of paragraphs again, but I ran into the same issues. I think it reads well now.
